# UI Workbench

A personal UI playground built with **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS**.

This project is used to design, experiment with, and showcase reusable UI components and layouts such as:

- Landing pages
- Cards & grids
- Dashboards
- Forms
- Animations
- Visual experiments

Each UI lives on its own route and can be previewed independently.
